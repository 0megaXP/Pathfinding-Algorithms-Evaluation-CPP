# Shard2D

Shard2D is an early-stage 2D rendering framework for the creation of 2D games and applications, created in C++ with the support of the SDL2 library.

## Work with Shard2D

Right now, Shard2D is not ready for the development. For now, you can only clone the repository and run the Visual Studio project.

## Requirements

Shard2D requires the library [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), including the [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/), [SDL_gfx](https://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/) and [SDL_rotozoom](https://www.ferzkopp.net/Software/SDL_rotozoom/) extensions. You can find the folder containing all you need from SDL2 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTsAmewe8OKMIsWog1njdB2fvA79n9E9/view?usp=sharing).
